# library

* 'JS' folder contains the "plain JS" versions of my backends
* 'WASM' folder contains the WebAssembly versions of my backends
* '3rdParty' folder contains backends that I did not create from scratch and with therefore are just available "as is"
* 'scriptprocessor_player.min.js' is the latest version of my player


Note: The WASM backends (see WASM switch in my respective make-scripts) can be used as a 
replacement for regular JS backends. They use less space and run faster, but at this
time they may not be supported my all browsers yet.
