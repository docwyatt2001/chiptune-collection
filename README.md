# Chiptune collection

Copyright (C) 2018 Juergen Wothke

This project provides the precompiled versions of all my WebAudio based chiptune
players (see my other projects). It allows to fetch a consistent and up-to-date
set without having to build the stuff yourself.

* 'library' folder contains the respective pre-built components
* 'blaster' folder provides an example web page showing the use of the components


Note: Some of the backend components in the 'library' at runtime depend on additional 
resources (config files). Respective data is not provided in the 'library' but it might 
be found in the 'blaster' example code.
